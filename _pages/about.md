I build things for the Internet.

I'm a software engineer based in New Delhi, IN specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional frontend and backend applications, and everything in between.

Although I'm not currently looking for any new opportunities, my inbox is always open. Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, I'll try my best to get back to you!
